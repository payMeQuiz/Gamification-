# What is payMe?

payMe is a tokenized intellectual empowerment platform, created to offer users the liberty of choice to work with and earn from their knowledge, seek more knowledge without restriction and freely socialize to improve their emotional intelligence, thus serving as a social justice crusader. At payMe we believe that every human is entitled to work, earn, learn and socialize; so, the platform uses the decentralization and democratization functions of the blockchain protocol to offer these rights to society.

Currently, payMe is piloted with gamification, pending the full development of the social media network intended to feature the digital library and community blogging where users can showcase their intellectual creativity and earn royalty from its usage.

payMe is the first incentivizing platform with a full Anti-Gambling protocol on the Blockchain, structured to serve as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in helping users break away from the habitual dependency on the game of chance and also in abstaining from examination malpractice.

payMe's incentivization function is powered from the Community's crowd-sourced asset with the platform's native token. The brand name 'payMe', indicates that every active member of the community is empowered.
